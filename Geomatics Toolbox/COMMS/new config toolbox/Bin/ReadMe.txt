Configuration Toolbox version 6.9.0.5
© 2013 Caterpillar Trimble Control Technologies LLC

Changes from 6.7.0.2 -> 6.8.0.3 and 6.8.0.3 -> 6.9.0.5 are listed below:

Enhancements in 6.8.0.3 (which was bundled with some Trimble systems but not released on its own) include:
* Support of new range of v10.50 coordinate systems that are supported by v3.90 firmware on MS990's and v1.50 firmware on MS980's.
* Reporting of CSIB version numbers and endian type.
* 2 periodic output appfile corruption fixes.  
* Some stability fixes and other bug fixes.

Enhancements in 6.9.0.1 include:
* Support for embedding geoid grids into coordinate systems within configuration files.
* A new Coordinate Settings dialog, which allows the user to perform backwards compatible operations with current receivers running older firmware, and also allows users to update configuration files originally created for older receivers to use the new coordinate system functionality on current receivers.
* Support for MS992 and SPSx61 receivers.
* Stopped the annoying "Unknown Antenna Type" dialog from appearing when viewing configuration files sent from receivers where the receiver was not actively using a specified elevation dependant antenna model.
* When editing an appfile generated by SVO, CToolbox now displays the actual coordinate system that will be used by the receiver (including modifications due to plane approximation or embedded geoid grids). Previously, it displayed the coordinate system that SVO referenced. The textual configuration file report now provides information about both coordinate systems contained in the configuration file.
* Other bug fixes.

Enhancements in 6.9.0.2 include:
* Support for SPS852 and SPS882 receivers. They will appear as SPS85x and SPS88x receivers respectively.
* Support for outputting RTCM3 correction messages on the Output page.
* Stopped certain warning messages from popping up when CToolbox isn't running in interactive mode (when called by SVO).

Enhancements in 6.9.0.3 include:
* Special handling of Automatic Coordinate Systems. These coordinate systems are created on the fly within the GPS receiver, so any coordinate
  information in those cases should be considered read-only.
* Support for outputting CMRx correction messages on the Output page.
* (Full install only): Updated Geoid Grids that now have the correct WGS84_BASED flags settings. This affects the following Geoid Grids:
	-EGM96
	-OSU91A
	-NGS GEOIDXX models

Enhancements in 6.9.0.4 include:
* Not checking for extents when an embedded geoid grid is passed from TBC.
* Support for requesting 20 Hz CMR outputs on MS992 and Any Receiver configuration files.
* This release is packaged with TBC only and is not available within a standalone installer.

Enhancements in 6.9.0.5 include:
* Adding support for logging corrections.
* Adding support for setting the RTCM v3 correction ID.
* Adding autobase support for many more SPSxxx receivers.
* Adding support for the MS352 and SPS985 receivers, and also "Any Receiver" connection support for the SPS552 receiver.
* Fixed a potential problem with unknown zones being included in zone based sites on import from a DC file (also used with SVO).
* Support for 2 second CMRx output.
* Support for USB port output on those receivers that have a USB port.

SPECIAL NOTE: CToolbox does not support version 3.1x firmware running on SPS receivers.
(These receivers include the SPS550/550H/750/850/880). CToolbox will detect if your receiver
is running unsupported firmware and will refuse to do any operations with the receiver
(such as sending or receiving appfiles from the receiver) if it is running unsupported firmware.

Also note that Appfiles downloaded from SPS and MS990 receivers running 3.3x firmware will not 
be accepted by receivers running 3.2x firmware.
